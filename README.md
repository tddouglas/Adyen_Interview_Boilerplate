# Adyen_Interview_Boilerplate
A boilerplate template for deploying webapps via Heroku


## Sample Deploy to Heroku Button
To Deploy app to website:
1. Have a Heroku Account
1. Click this  button - 
[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)
1. Enter App Name
1. Click Deploy!

## Setup automatic deployment
Can easily set up automatic deployment by going to your project in Heroku >> Deploy and connecting it to your github and then chosing the branch and "Enable Automatic Deploys"

This makes it easy to test small changes even after you've deployed your app. 

### Requirements:
Heroku can deploy apps written in Ruby, Node. js, Java, Python, Clojure, Scala, Go and PHP so your app would need to be written in one of those languages. You also need a Heroku account which is free, but you can only deploy 5 apps for free on Heroku so might be an issue with people who already have 5 apps deployed. Although, not sure how many people do. 

This setup also assumes knowledge of git and specifically usage of github.
